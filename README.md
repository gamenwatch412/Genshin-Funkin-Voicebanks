# FAQ
**Q: Will you ever release the flps for these songs?** <br />
**A:** No. There are many reasons I can't, but to condense it, it's a huge hassle to make a flp that anyone can use right away, because I used way too many plugins and sound samples for them that it will be too complicated to make accesible for people. You are allowed to make covers by just using the midis and the instrumental track however. <br /> <br />
**Q: Is there a soundfont available? I don't want to use chromatics.** <br />
**A:** Not at the moment. Probably because I'm lazy to export the audio samples into one lol. If anyone is willing to make one though, let me know on discord (Gamenwatch412#7632) before you upload it to gamebanana first.
**Q: These sound terrible! Remake (insert character)'s chromatic damn it!** <br />
**A:** First off, chill lol. Yeah I know they sound bad (Raiden Shogun's in particular), but I am in the process of remaking them to sound better and cleaner. Just bear with me for now.
